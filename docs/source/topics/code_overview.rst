Code Overview
-------------

Descriptor based analysis is a powerful tool for understanding the
trends across various catalysts. In general, the rate of a reaction over
a given catalyst is a function of many parameters - reaction energies,
activation barriers, thermodynamic conditions, etc. The high
dimensionality of this problem makes it very difficult and expensive to
solve completely and even a full solution would not give much insight
into the rational design of new catalysts. The descriptor based approach
seeks to determine a few "descriptors" upon which the other parameters
are dependent. By doing this it is possible to reduce the dimensionality
of the problem - preferably to 1 or 2 descriptors - thus greatly
reducing computational efforts and simultaneously increasing the
understanding of trends in catalysis.

The "catmap" Python module seeks to standardize and automate many of the
mathematical routines necessary to move from "descriptor space" to
reaction rates. The module is designed to be both flexible and powerful.
A "reaction model" can be fully defined by a configuration file, thus no
new programming is necessary to change the complexity or assumptions of
a model. Furthermore, various steps in the process of moving from
descriptors to reaction rates have been abstracted into separate Python
classes, making it easy to change the methods used or add new
functionality. The downside of this approach is that it makes the code
more complex. The purpose of this guide is to explain the general
structure of the code, as well as its specific functions and how to
begin using it.

**Useful Definitions: (Note symbols may not appear in Safari/IE)**

- descriptor - variable used to describe reaction kinetics at a high
  level. Most commonly these are the binding energies of atomic
  constituents in the adsorbates (e.g. carbon/nitrogen/oxygen adsorption
  energies) or other intermediates. However, in the general sense other
  variables such as electronic structure parameters (e.g. d-band center)
  or thermodynamic parameters (e.g. temperature/pressure) could also be
  descriptors.
- descriptor space ( :math:`D` ) - the space spanned by the
  descriptors. Usually :math:`\mathbb{R}^2`.
- parameter space ( :math:`P` ) - the space spanned
  by the full reaction parameters for the reaction model. Usually :math:`\mathbb{R}^{2n}`
  where n is the number of elementary steps (one reaction energy and one
  reaction barrier per elementary step).
- reaction rates ( :math:`r` ) - an n-vector of rates corresponding to each of the n
  elementary reactions.  
- descriptor map - a map of some variable (rates,coverages,etc.) as a
  function of descriptor space. 
- reaction model - a set of elementary steps and conditions which define the
  physics of the kinetic system, along with the mathematical methods and
  assumptions used to move from "descriptor space" to reaction rates. 
- setup file - a file used to define the reaction model 
- input file - a file used to store other data which is likely common to many
  reaction models (e.g. energetics data)

**Code Structure:**

-  The interface to the code is handled through the *ReactionModel*
   class. This class acts as a messenger class which broadcasts all its
   attributes to the other classes used in the kinetics module. The
   class also handles common functions such as printing
   reactions/adsorbates or comparing/reversing elementary steps. The
   attributes of *ReactionModel* are automatically synchronized with the
   parser, scaler, solver, and mapper so it is useful to think of
   *ReactionModel* as a "toolbox" where all the necessary information
   and common functions are stored.

-   The *Parser* class serves to extend the "setup file" by reading in
    various quantities from an "input file". Technically the use of a parser
    is optional, but in practice it is extremely helpful for reading in
    common data such as adsorption energies or vibrational frequencies
    rather than re-typing them for every reaction model.

The process of creating a "descriptor map" is abstracted into three
general processes, which are handled by the following classes within the
kinetics module:

*Scaler:* Projects descriptor space into parameter space: *D* → *P*

*Solver:* Maps parameter space into reaction rates: *P* → *r*

*Mapper:* Moves through descriptor space. This becomes important for
practical reasons since it is often necessary to use a solution at one
point in descriptor space as an initial guess for a nearby point.

The *ThermoCorrections* class is responsible for applying thermodynamic
corrections to the electronic energies which are used as direct inputs.
This includes the contributions of entropy/enthalpy and zero-point
energy due to temperature, pressure, or other thermodynamic variables.

There are also a variety of analysis classes which allow for automated
analysis and visualization of the reaction model. These include the
*VectorMap* and *MatrixMap* classes which create plots of outputs as a
function of descriptor space. The *VectorMap* class is designed for
outputs in the form of vectors (rates, coverages, etc.) while the
*MatrixMap* is designed for outputs in the form of matrices (rate
control, sensitivity analyses, etc.). The analysis folder also contains
*MechanismAnalysis* which creates free energy diagrams, and
*ScalingAnalysis* which can give a visual representation of how well the
scaler projects descriptor space to parameter space.

**Using the code:**

Some examples can be found in the :doc:`../tutorials/index`, and
these should explain the syntax necessary and serve as a good starting
point. The currently implemented features are also briefly described
below in order to allow a better understanding of the demos and creating
original reaction setup files.

Using the kinetics module to conduct a descriptor analysis requires (at
least) 2 files: the "setup file" which defines the reaction model, as
well as another script to initialize the ReactionModel class and conduct
analyses. The "setup file" is generally a static file (i.e. it is not a
program) while the submission script will be an actual python program.
Setup files typically end in ".mkm" for micro-kinetic model (although
this is not required) while submission scripts end in .py since they are
just python scripts. In addition it is very useful to also have an
"input file" which contains the raw data about the energetics of the
reaction model. An example of how to create an input file based on a
table-like format is given in the :doc:`../tutorials/generating_an_input_file` tutorial.

Each class described in the **Code Structure** section will require some
specialized parameters. Some of these parameters are common to all
variants of these classes, while others are specific to certain
implementations. The possible inputs for the currently implemented
variants of each class are listed below. Required attributes are
+underlined+.

-  *ReactionModel:*

   -  rxn\_expressions - These expressions determine the elementary
      reaction, and are the most important part of the model. They must
      be defined unless the elementary\_rxns, adsorbate\_names,
      transition\_state\_names, and gas\_names are all explicitly
      defined since the rxn\_expressions are parsed into these 3
      attributes. It is much easier to just define rxn\_expressions,
      although it is important to note the syntax. There must be spaces
      between all elements of each expression (i.e. C\ *+O\* is not
      okay, but C\* + O\* is), and species ending with \_g are gasses by
      default. Adsorbed species may end with * or \_x where \*
      designates adsorption at the "s" site (by default), while \_x
      designates adsorption at the "x" site (note that "x" may be any
      letter except "g", and that X\* and X\_s are equivalent).
      Transition-states should include a -, and reactions with a
      transition-state are specified by 'IS <-> TS -> FS' while
      reactions without a transition-state are defined as 'IS -> FS'
      (where IS,TS,FS are expressions for the Initial/Transition/Final
      State). When the model initializes it checks the expressions for
      mass/site balances, and if it finds that they are not balanced it
      will raise an exception. [list of strings]. Instead of specifying
      rxn\_expressions the following attributes may instead be defined:

      -  elementary\_rxns - list version of rxn\_expressions. These will
         be automatically populated if rxn\_expressions are defined.
         [list of lists of lists]

      -  adsorbate\_names - list of adsorbate names included in the
         analysis. Automatically populated if rxn\_expressions are
         defined. [list of strings]

      -  transition\_state\_names - list of transition-state names
         included in the analysis. Automatically populated if
         rxn\_expressions are defined. [list of strings]

      -  gas\_names - list of gas names included in the analysis. [list
         of strings]

   -  surface\_names - list of surface names to be included in the
      analysis. [list of strings]

   -  species\_definitions - This is a dictionary where all
      species-specific information is stored. The required information
      will vary depending on the scaler/thermo corrections/solver/mapper
      used, and the "parser" generally fills in most information.
      However, there are a few things which generally need to be
      supplied explicitly:

      -  species\_definitions[*site*\ ]['site\_names'] (where \*site\*
         is each site name in the model) - A list of "site names" which
         correspond to \*site\*. If the TableParser (default) is being
         used then the "site names" must also match the designations in
         the "site\_name" column. For example, if you want the "s" site
         to correspond to the energetics of an adsorbate at a (211)
         site, and (211) sites are designated by '211' in the site\_name
         column of the input\_file, then this would be specified by:
         species\_definitions['s'] = {'site\_names':['211']}. Similarly,
         if you wanted the 't' site to correspond to 'fcc' or 'bridge'
         sites then you could specify: species\_definitions['t'] =
         {'site\_names':['fcc','bridge']}.

      -  species\_definitions[*site*\ ]['total'] (where \*site\* is each
         site name in the model) - A number to which the total coverage
         of \*site\* must sum. For example, if you wanted to have a
         total coverage of 1 with 10% 's' sites and 90% 't' sites (with
         the same site definitions as above) you would specify:
         species\_definitions['s'] = {'site\_names':['211'],'total':0.1}
         and species\_definitions['t'] =
         {'site\_names':['fcc','bridge'],'total:0.9}.

      -  species\_definitions[*gas*\ ]['pressure'] (where \*gas\* is
         each gas name in the model including the trailing \_g) - The
         pressure of each gas species in bar. For example, if you wanted
         a carbon monoxide pressure of 10 bar and hydrogen pressure of
         20 bar you would specify:
         species\_definitions['CO\_g']['pressure'] = 10 and
         species\_definitions['H2\_g']['pressure'] = 20. Note that for
         some situations you may instead need to specify a
         'concentration','approach\_to\_equilibrium', or some other key,
         but in almost every situation some method for obtaining the gas
         pressures must be specified for each gas in the model.

      of floats].

   -  numerical\_representation - determines how to store numbers as
      binary. Can be 'mpmath' for multiple precision or 'numpy' for
      normal floats. Note that 'numpy' rarely works. Defaults to
      'mpmath'. [string]

-  *Parser:*

   -  input\_file - file where input data is stored. File must be in the
      correct format for the parser used. See :doc:`../tutorials/generating_an_input_file` for more
      information.

-  *Scaler:*

   -  gas\_thermo\_mode - Approximation used for obtaining gas-phase
      free energy corrections. Defaults to ideal\_gas. Other
      possibilities are: shomate\_gas (use Shomate equation),

      fixed\_entropy\_gas (include zero-point and assume entropy is
      0.002 eV/K) , frozen\_gas (no corrections),
      frozen\_zero\_point\_gas (no zero-point and entropy is 0.002
      eV/K). [string]
   -  adsorbate\_thermo\_mode - Approximation used for obtaining
      adsorbate free energy corrections. Defaults to harmonic\_adsorbate
      (use statistical mechanics+vibrational frequencies). Other
      possibilities are: hindered\_adsorbate (statistical mechanics +
      vibrational frequencies + translational frequencies + rotational
      frequencies), zero\_point\_adsorbate (zero-point corrections
      only), frozen\_gas (no corrections). [string]

-  *Solver:*

      which are the nearest points on the orthogonals and diagonals plus
      the current point. More directions increase the chances of
      findinga good solution, but slow the mapper down considerably.
      Note that the current point corresponds to an initial guess
      coverage provided by the solver (i.e. Boltzmann coverages) and
      should always be included unless some solutions are already known.
